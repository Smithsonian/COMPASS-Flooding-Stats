      <abstract>Due to their position at the land-sea interface, coastal wetlands are sensitive to sea-level rise and many other aspects of global change. Small changes in coastal wetland surface elevation can lead to comparatively large changes in coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function, and in some cases wetland loss. The surface elevation table (SET)-marker horizon (MH) approach (SET-MH, together) is a method for quantifying net wetland surface elevation change while accounting for the relative contributions of various biological, geological, and hydrological processes that can occur within different segments of the soil profile (e.g., deep, shallow subsurface, and surface soil depths). This data release includes long-term and high temporal resolution surface elevation table (SET) and marker horizon (MH) data from nine study sites in Everglades National Park.

All data files and their associated metadata documentation can be found within "Everglades NP SET-MH Data (ver 2.0, July 2019).zip".

Version 2.0 revised and reposted online July 2019 

Changes in version 2.0 

1. Added several additional columns of sediment elevation and marker horizon data from sampling events from the period between September 2014 and April 2019. 
2. Revised the SET pin height values collected prior to April 2019 to reflect the length of new fiberglass pins. Note that in some instances this conversion resulted in negative pin height values. 
3. Added data from new marker horizon plots that were installed during the May 2017 or December 2018 sampling events.
